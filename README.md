# Deep learning in Physics - Nanoscience group
This is our project for the master course Deep Learning in Physics (WMPH054-05) at the University of Groningen. 

We aim to use machine learning approaches to classify the symmetry of materials based on their XRD patterns. 
## Description
Our project is based on the following paper:

***"Oviedo, F., Ren, Z., Sun, S., Settens, C., Liu, Z., Hartono, N. T. P., ... & Buonassisi, T. (2019). Fast and interpretable classification of small X-ray diffraction datasets using data augmentation and deep neural networks. npj Computational Materials, 5(1), 60."

## Usage
To install, clone the following repository: 
https://github.com/Stulejarz/DLP_autoXRD.git

All the relevant code written by us is in the notebook `model_evaluation_cleaned.ipynb`. The file `autoXRD.py` was written by the original authors and is necessary for data processing and augmentation. Datasets can be found in the Datasets folder.
